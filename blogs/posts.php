        "body" => "<p>It all started with a vision—a dream—conceivhed by Vinolia Apakoh, Founder & CEO of Blackcellence Network. As she settled into the Saskatchewan community with her family, Vinolia noticed that many individuals, like herself, had relocated from their home countries to make a life here. What struck her most was the realization that, regardless of their diverse backgrounds, these people all had unique and remarkable stories to tell. This was especially evident within the Black community.</p>

                    <p>Vinolia observed that many individuals were excelling in their professional fields—whether in business, healthcare, law, engineering, education, and more. Their work ethic was inspiring, and their brilliance was unmatched. Yet, what stood out to her was that this excellence often went unrecognized. Their stories remained largely untold, hidden like diamonds and rare minerals waiting to be discovered. It became clear that there was a gap to fill—a need to shine a light on these remarkable individuals and their achievements.</p>

                    <p>The natural response was to create a platform where these stories could be shared, and where these individuals could be honored within their community. This sparked the idea for an event to bring this vision to life.</p>

                    <p>To turn this idea into reality, Vinolia—who is also the CEO of Akwaaba Foods, a catering business specializing in Ghanaian cuisine and deeply rooted in community values—partnered with Black In Saskatchewan to host the inaugural Blackcellence Gala.</p>

                    <p>At the 2022 Blackcellence Gala, the Saskatchewan community gathered to celebrate the contributions of the Black community. The Guest of Honor, Dr. Samra Sahlu, addressed the important theme of mental health in the Black community and healthcare. The Gala’s beneficiary was City Kidz Regina, with all proceeds directed to this local organization. The event also honored outstanding individuals in various fields, including entrepreneurs, young athletes, and healthcare professionals, recognizing their significant contributions to the community. Hosting this first Gala was a major learning experience, and the enthusiasm it generated inspired the decision to make it an annual event.</p>

                    <p>The second edition of the Gala in 2023 was even more successful. This time, we celebrated Women of Excellence in athletics, business, and entrepreneurship. We raised the bar, sparking more interest than ever before, with attendance more than doubling from the previous year. This growth led to the formation of new community relationships, which were further solidified throughout the event. The success of the second edition resulted in a significant donation to Dress for Success, a non-profit organization dedicated to supporting the societal needs of women.</p>

        "body" => "<p>On September 14th 2024, the Living Hope Alliance Church hosted the 1st edition of the Ankara Carnival Day 2024. An event aimed at putting to light the beauty of “Ankara” (Ann-Kah-Rah) and the “Adire” (Ah-Dee-Reh).</p>

                    <h5>Origin of Ankara</h5>

                    <p>In Nigeria, the word Ankara is what people call African Textile wears. Interestingly, Ankara is another word to refer to the country of Ghana. It is somewhat of a legend being told that in the 19th Century, Ghana was a major commercial Hub for African Textile and the Hausa people who are well-known traders of textiles referred to Ghana as Ankara in their Native Hausa tongue. When they brought these fabrics back from Ghana to their homes in Nigeria, people called these fabrics Ankara and so it was baptized.</p>

                    <img alt='photo of Ankara material'></img>

                    <p>This rich textile made from cotton is a staple of contemporary fashion today. It is widely adopted by all for its versatility as casual, semi-formal, and formal attires that are synonymous with celebration due to the use of vibrant colours and patterns.</p>

                    <h5>Origin of Adire</h5>

                    <p>In Yoruba culture, Adire is a format of storytelling using vibrant colours and patterns to portray aspects of our daily life, elements of nature, or even proverbs. Adire can be referred to as Tie and Dye. In the 20th century, it was pioneered by women artisans who used dyeing techniques to imprint patterns onto cotton fabrics.</p>

                    <p>The use of indigo, a dye derived from plants, is the distinctive trait of Adire, lending the fabric its characteristic blue shade. This colour was not chosen randomly; it holds cultural significance, often symbolizing depth, stability, and wisdom in Yoruba culture. And like Ankara, Adire is an African Textile Wear associated with celebration. </p>

                    <p>It is prevalent to see people harbour these beautiful fabrics on special occasions, as the colours and patterns seen on these are synonymous with celebration.</p>

                    <p>The Ankara Carnival Day 2024 was a sight to behold, an occasion for all to engage with African Culture through dressing. On the agenda, there were Fashion and Traditional Dance Contests, Community Award presentations, and of course, food and Nigerian Cuisine to particular! With a special mention of Amala and Ogunfe plus Ofada on Stand as well as vendors of African wears and accessories to complement the beautiful display of art happening in all forms within the walls of the Hope Alliance Church. The event amassed a great turnout! With admission being free, everyone was welcome, and that in turn was seen in the enthusiasm and engagement that was put forward by guests attending.</p>

                    <p>The Ankara Carnival was a day of honors for Blackcellence Network. Our CEO & Founder Vinolia Apakoh was among the individuals being honored at the Ankara carnival for the Pacesetters Award. An award aimed at honoring individuals in the community who serve as exemplary leaders.</p>

                    <p>Blackcellence Network Congratulates Mrs. Vinolia on her award and thanks the Ankara Carnival organizing committee for upholding our culture with this unique perspective.</p>
